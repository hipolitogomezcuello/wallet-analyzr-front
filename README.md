# Wallet Analyzr Front End

Hello! This is the front end for my challenge project for Securitize.

This project is deployed and available at https://wallet-analyzr.vercel.app/
I decided on vercel, since it is extermely easy to deploy React apps there.

You'll need to register, but don't worry, it has a very simple authorization system. You can use any username and password you want, and it will be accepted.

It was really fun making this, however, I had only 3 days to make it so there's a plethora of things I would like to improve. I'll list some of them below:

- Add proper front end validation for various inputs
- Context API for state management
- Better error handling
- Conteinerize the app

If you have any feedback, please reach out! I'm always looking to improve.
